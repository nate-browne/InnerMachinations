## Harmony
---

This is part 3 of a 7 part series on musical analysis and decomposition! It's been a while, but it's back.
<br><br>
<a href="innermachinations/music/2019/08/24/Music-Decomp-Odd.html" target="_blank">Last time</a>, we talked about
the effects of time signatures on music and how they play into the creation of pieces themselves. This time,
we're gonna discuss one of the fundamental building blocks of musical terminology: harmony.
<br><br>
To begin, we should first give a rudimentary definition of harmony so that we're all on the same page. Simply put,
*harmony* is the process by which invidiual sounds (or superpositions of sounds) are analyzed by hearing. We do
this by studying combinations of pitches (known as *chords*) and looking at the transitions between chords in a piece
(known as a *chord progression*), all the while keeping in mind the relationships and principles of connection between
the chords.
<br><br>
Harmony comes in many flavors, and in most genres, there are certain conventions and prevailing styles of harmony depending
on what that genre is known for. Rock harmony, Jazz harmony, Classical harmony, etc. tend to be separate (with some overlaps), and
as such cannot be treated identically. One interesting concept arises in the practice of "reharmonization", which can
drastically change the feel of a song/piece and turn it into a totally different composition (as we'll discuss; check out
<a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=YLIqYiQGSJM" target="_blank">this reharm of "Hello" by Adele</a> to see what I mean.)
<br><br>
Let's start with the basics before doing any analysis.

## Additional Songs
If you like what you've heard, here are some more in a similar style:
* [*In the Bleak Midwinter*](https://invidio.us/watch?v=7-nRv0uQvH0) by Jacob Collier.
* [*Moon River*](https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=KhyyjRcrn84) by Jacob Collier.
* [*Moon River*](https://invidio.us/watch?v=7h3rTNai9W0) by Voctave. Note how the differences in
  harmonic influence lead this version to sound totally different than Jacob's, even though it's the some song!

If you really like this stuff, check out <a href="https://www.invidio.us/channel/havic5" target="_blank">Adam Neely</a>, he posts
a lot of videos explaining music theory in general (and harmony in specific)!
<br><br>
*Next time, we'll talk about how music is structed and how that affects our perception.*
