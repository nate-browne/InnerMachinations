## Harmony
---

This is part 3 of a 7 part series on musical analysis and decomposition! It's been a while, but it's back.
<br><br>
<a href="innermachinations/music/2019/08/24/Music-Decomp-Odd.html" target="_blank">Last time</a>, we talked about
the effects of time signatures on music and how they play into the creation of pieces themselves. This time,
we're gonna discuss one of the fundamental building blocks of musical terminology: harmony.
<br><br>
To begin, we should first give a rudimentary definition of harmony so that we're all on the same page. Simply put,
*harmony* is the process by which invidiual sounds (or superpositions of sounds) are analyzed by hearing. We do
this by studying combinations of pitches (known as *chords*) and looking at the transitions between chords in a piece
(known as a *chord progression*), all the while keeping in mind the relationships and principles of connection between
the chords.
<br><br>
Harmony comes in many flavors, and in most genres, there are certain conventions and prevailing styles of harmony depending
on what that genre is known for. Rock harmony, Jazz harmony, Classical harmony, etc. tend to be separate (with some overlaps), and
as such cannot be treated identically. One interesting concept arises in the practice of "reharmonization", which can
drastically change the feel of a song/piece and turn it into a totally different composition (as we'll discuss in a later article; check out
<a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=YLIqYiQGSJM" target="_blank">this reharm of "Hello" by Adele</a> to see what I mean.)
<br><br>
Let's start with the basics before doing any analysis. Western music is broken up into a 12 tone, equal temperment system. "Equal temperment" just means that the amount of space between each note is equal, as opposed to systems that make use of natural harmonic
frequencies like "just intonation". A *scale* is a repeating sequence of notes, with a root note. Scales are composed of *intervals*,
which are gaps between two notes. Intervals come in a few types: *major*, *minor*, *augmented*, *diminished*, and *perfect*. I won't
get into the meaning of those, but using different combinations of intervals, we end up with scales that posess different properties
(such as major scales, minor scales, whole tone scales, pentatonic scales, modes, etc). A *scale degree* is the position of a note in
a scale (read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music)" target="_blank">here</a>). They go both by names and numbers,
where the root note of a key is always labeled with a I. The names imply the function of the note, while the number implies location.
<br><br>
A *chord* is built up of stacked intervals on top of each other, with the simpliest being a *triad*. Chords can be built up by stacking
different intervals (3rds, 4ths, etc) with stacked 3rds being the most common. As you can probably guess, chords can also have different
properties (major, minor, augmented, diminished, etc) but interestingly, chords also have *extensions*. An *extension* is when you stack more intervals on top of each other, adding more color to each chord. These are commonly seen in music with Jazz influence. Lastly,
a *chord progression* as I said earlier, is the sequence of chords followed by a song/work. While this may seem arbitrary, it is anything but; the chord progression of a song sets the tone for how it feels, and even changing one chord in a progression leads to a drastically
different sound (even with the same melody!)
<br><br>
I know, lots of backstory. And I really rushed through it too. That said, we should have enough background to start analyzing our choices.
Surprisingly, this time, one of our songs we're analyzing isn't instrumental! In any case, let's get started.
<br><br>
## Song 1: <a href="https://invidio.us/watch?v=wEp9MCQlAa4" target="_blank">Spectrum (ft. Matthew Koma) - Zedd</a>
<br>
Melodically, this song is pretty simple overall. The reason this song is so appealing, besides the vintage 2012 Zedd beat drop, is the chords;
this song diverts away from the normal pop music progression and does so spectacularly. Pop music tends to follow a "4 chord" structure,
so much so that it's <a href="https://invidio.us/watch?v=g_Z1zpCYVf0" target="_blank">the subject of musical memes.</a>
The pattern, regardless of key, follows (either exactly or with a slight deviation) the following: the tonic (a.k.a. the I chord or the root chord), the dominant (a.k.a. the V chord), the submediant (a.k.a. the VI chord, a minor chord), and the subdominant (a.k.a. the IV chord).

## Additional Songs
If you like what you've heard, here are some more in a similar style:
* [*In the Bleak Midwinter*](https://invidio.us/watch?v=7-nRv0uQvH0) by Jacob Collier.
* [*Moon River*](https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=KhyyjRcrn84) by Jacob Collier.
* [*Moon River*](https://invidio.us/watch?v=7h3rTNai9W0) by Voctave. Note how the differences in
  harmonic influence lead this version to sound totally different than Jacob's, even though it's the some song!

If you really like this stuff, check out <a href="https://www.invidio.us/channel/havic5" target="_blank">Adam Neely</a>, he posts
a lot of videos explaining music theory in general (and harmony in specific)!
<br><br>
*Next time, we'll talk about how music is structed and how that affects our perception.*
