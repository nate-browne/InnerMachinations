## My Worst Best Frenemy
---
On a slightly more personal note, I figured that this week would be as good a week as any to talk about inadequacy.
Probably not gonna be as many images in this one, so prepare yourself for a block of text. If you wanna skip it and come
back next week for another tech one or music decomposition one (haven't decided which one yet), feel free.

Ever since I was really little, I've been described by many as a very driven individual, with far too many interests
to be sustainable. At one point in middle school, I played cello in a chamber orchestra, trumpet in concert band,
played volleyball, and assisted with musicals by playing in the orchestra pit all while still taking classes (granted,
middle school classes are pretty much a joke but the point still stands).
<br><br>
In high school, it wasn't much different. Varsity volleyball, jazz band, jazz combo, choir, chamber choir, AP classes, praise band, and special events all combined to make it so that I was always super busy.

*Weird flex, but okay* I hear you think. Well, you're right. However, recently I've been doing a lot more thinking about **why** I did those things in high school.
